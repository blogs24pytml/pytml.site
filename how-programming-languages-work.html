    <h1>How Different Programming Languages Work Together</h1>

    <p>
      When people hear the word <strong>programming</strong>, they often think there is
      one single language that does everything.  
      In reality, modern websites and apps are built using
      <strong>multiple programming languages</strong>, each with its own job.
    </p>

    <p>
      Think of it like a team: everyone has a role, and when they work together,
      things actually function properly.
    </p>

    <h2>HTML: The Structure</h2>
    <p>
      <code>HTML</code> is the foundation of the web.  
      It decides <strong>what exists</strong> on a page:
      text, headings, images, links, buttons, and sections.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without HTML, a website would simply have nothing to show.
      It is not responsible for looks or logic — just structure.
    </p>

    <h2>CSS: The Appearance</h2>
    <p>
      <code>CSS</code> controls how things look.
      Colors, fonts, spacing, layout, animations — all of that is CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      If HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin and clothing.
      A site without CSS works, but looks boring and unfinished.
    </p>

    <h2>JavaScript: The Interaction</h2>
    <p>
      <code>JavaScript</code> makes websites interactive.
      Clicking buttons, loading content without refreshing the page,
      validating forms — JavaScript handles these tasks.
    </p>
    <p>
      It allows a website to <strong>respond to the user</strong>
      instead of being a static page.
    </p>

    <h2>Python: The Brain Behind the Scenes</h2>
    <p>
      <code>Python</code> is commonly used on the server side.
      It can generate HTML files, handle databases, automate tasks,
      and process data.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even if users never see Python directly, it often powers
      the logic that makes a website useful.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Multiple Languages Exist</h2>
    <p>
      Different problems need different tools.
      One language trying to do everything would be slow, messy,
      and hard to maintain.
    </p>
    <p>
      By splitting responsibilities across languages,
      developers can build faster, cleaner, and more reliable systems.
    </p>

    <h2>Learning One Helps You Learn Others</h2>
    <p>
      Once you understand how one programming language works,
      learning another becomes easier.
      Concepts like logic, structure, and problem-solving
      transfer across languages.
    </p>

    <p>
      Programming is less about memorizing syntax
      and more about understanding <strong>how systems work together</strong>.
    </p>

    <h1>This Website: Explained</h1>

    <p>
      This page was created using <strong>two core languages</strong> of the web:
      <code>HTML</code> and <code>CSS</code>.  
      The file itself was generated using <code>Python</code>, showing how different
      programming languages can work together.
    </p>

    <h2>What is Coding?</h2>
    <p>
      Coding is the process of writing instructions that computers can understand.
      These instructions tell software how to behave, what to display, and how to
      respond to users.
    </p>

    <h2>How Browsers Render Websites</h2>
    <p>
      When you open a website in Chrome, the browser reads the HTML file line by line,
      builds the structure of the page, applies styles using CSS, and finally renders
      everything visually on your screen.
    </p>

    <h2>Why HTML, CSS, and More?</h2>
    <p>
      HTML defines the structure, CSS controls the appearance, and JavaScript adds
      interactivity. Beyond that, languages like Python, PHP, and Java can generate
      content, handle servers, and manage data behind the scenes.
